I've heard so many good things about Bobby Brown but I hadn't tried any of the products I was excited that I was sent their Face Base. I always use primer before I put my makeup on and I'm always looking for a new one to try I really liked this one it smells so good because of the vitamin C and it makes my skin so smooth and a little bit goes a long way but the only problem is that I wish it came in a bigger jar I would hate to have to pay alot of money just for that size",
