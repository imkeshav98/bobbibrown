## End Notes

In this project we tried to make the clone of the bobbibrown website as close to real one by using all the technical skills that we have learned up until now. We tried making it using React, Redux, CSS, AntDesign and Javascript . We have also created the backend part of this website which is use for authentication as well as storing, seaching data of the products , add product, remove products & also get the total sum from the backend. The search keywords is passed to the backend inorder to get keywords related results. Workflow is not the same as original. We tried our best to clone it.
